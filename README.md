# Profile CSS

Structured lists of CSS links that you want to explore:

 * [CSS rendering performances](performances/rendering.md) 


## Purpose

As I love the `awesome` initiatives, I will not visit hundreds of links to learn about a specific subject.
So I give a try to another format, named `profile`, to promote (and store) my best links.

 * A theme description
 * Approximately 10 links structured by sub-themes
 * A short description for each link with why it should be read


# Selection

Some of great links are not in the profile, probably for one of this reasons:

 * Focus: there is several themes addressed
 * Independent: There is too much links in it, that you have to follow to understand the subject
 * Unique: There is already a great link referenced that is too much similar
 * Context: There is no date or no explicit author
 * Comfort: There is too much advertisement or it's not readable
 
If you still think one link is missing from a profile page, you can [open an issue][open-issue].
