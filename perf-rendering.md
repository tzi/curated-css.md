# CSS rendering performance

CSS rendering performance is the efficiency to compute styles after everything is loaded.
The purpose is to get fluid interfaces, for example fast scrolls or **smooth animations**.
Todo that we need to get the browser rendering the page at **60fps everywhere**.


## What actually happens in the browser? 

Thereâ€™s no universal solution to improve render performance, it depends on your use-case.
The best beginning is to understand the steps which the browser has to do to get pixels onto the screen.

## Experience Feedback

 * [GitHub's CSS Performance (Slides)][github-slides] or [(Video)][github-video]

> GitHub had some pages with *almost 30s of style recalculation (slide 19)*,
because of particular conditions like *50k DOM elements (slide 63)*.
In this hard context, they had to drastically simplify their HTML and CSS.

> One of the best point is that *less than half of the people that touch the CSS (slide 101)* are *CSS developers (slide 102)*.
So you have to have rules and tools to monitor your CSS, like the number of selectors.
